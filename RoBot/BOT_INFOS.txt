How does the bots works ?
    Using discord.py, and the Roblox Users Api v1, the bot will generate 3 words, that the user will have to put
    in his bio, then the bot will check if the generated words are in the user's bio. If yes, then it will create a repertory
    in the json file that contains the roblox user's id and the user's discord id.

    The userinfos command is checking in the json file if there is the target's user id is in there. If yes then
    we'll show the user's infos.

    The devex command divide by 10000 and then multiply the value by 35. And if the argument is missing, it's just showing 100 000 R$ = 350 USD.

Commands :
    devex, #shows the value of USD once robux exchange [1 optional argument (robux amout)]
    verify, #starts the verifaction [0 argument]
    checkbio, #once the verify command done, this command will check if the user's bio is the given one. [1 required argument (user's id)]
    userinfos #allows users to read informations of a logged user. [1 required argument (target user)]
